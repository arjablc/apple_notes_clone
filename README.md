# Clone of the Apple Notes App

For the people at DoorBean: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

I am unsure about what I should include in the requirements file. On research, I found it to be explicit for python projects. However, I have included the packages from pub.dev and the sdk that is used in this project.
